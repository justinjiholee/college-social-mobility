# Social Mobility Rates of Colleges

## Background
In these days, many people look at various factors when choosing their colleges. As they tend to consider receiving college education and diplomas to be an opportunity to climb up the social ladder, social mobility rates of colleges have been an essential factor. There are many metrics contributing to social mobility rates of colleges. I decided to look at instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings and conduct a cluster analysis to see how the colleges are grouped together and how these variables affect the mobility rates. 

## Business Question
_How are colleges grouped based on the the different metrics of instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings after graduation? How does these variables contribute to social mobility rates of colleges?_

**Cluster 1** has the highest standard deviations of instructional expenditures compared to other clusters. Standard deviations of median earnings are high above the average as well, while net cost of attendance are below average. The social mobility rate is slightly above the average.

**Cluster 2** has the highest standard deviations of net cost of attendance, while instructional expenditures and median earnings are slightly above the average. The social mobility rate is below the average.

**Cluster 3** has the highest standard deviations of median earnings. Instructional expenditures are slightly above the average and net cost of attendance is below the average. The social mobility rate is slightly below the average.

**Cluster 4** has standard deviations of all instructional expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings above the average. The social mobility rate is very high above the average.
