# Social Mobility Rates of Colleges

## Background
In these days, many people look at various factors when choosing their colleges. As they tend to consider receiving college education and diplomas to be an opportunity to climb up the social ladder, social mobility rates of colleges have been an essential factor. There are many metrics contributing to social mobility rates of colleges. I decided to look at instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings and conduct a cluster analysis to see how the colleges are grouped together and how these variables affect the mobility rates. 

## Business Question
_How are colleges grouped based on the the different metrics of instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings after graduation? How does these variables contribute to social mobility rates of colleges?_
