# Social Mobility Rates of Colleges

## Background
In these days, many people look at various factors when choosing their colleges. As they tend to consider receiving college education and diplomas to be an opportunity to climb up the social ladder, social mobility rates of colleges have been an essential factor. There are many metrics contributing to social mobility rates of colleges. I decided to look at instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings and conduct a cluster analysis to see how the colleges are grouped together and how these variables affect the mobility rates. 

## Business Question
_How are colleges grouped based on the the different metrics of instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, and median earnings after graduation? How does these variables contribute to social mobility rates of colleges?_

## Cluster Analysis

Extracting the data from [Opportunity Insights Data Library](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=100&topic=105&paper_id=0&__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=ef6841bb98c2ff2476be0256794679f3b064204c-1616058925-0-AUDeaNgtBOBzBCULDKw1Jm7e0b_1tZ9XHeSi2PROBSWAV0tmeq6wUfnpOXNlNFk5dI-0hdAJf_RiC3z3z-6yVwM_KmCiovMn2WO60PHTD_uzuZkU1JJoshPpbMz-y-KgYSAF4EUYQHyO-ObIFu43YkEnvygs8VqntG9z5FIZ59vBIm_60bn_-0uxXPp5R1rxgw-fY5HAgncWs6c4YgDPY0kkCTvKRoT4YpNxCZ3smSuuI_Z0DaV6S7INw-ajHvtsF7yVCfpHmqu3eWBMkCJ9F9pOd4Rat3p6tL2ScaJRSEgDBVLQcGFV-jHboZqbFIGNggDh3WT0E4PJdElBvKLkXH6DK1rBC5aw9Cp80mv6vbhyJmPzhJ-JsztZHTV9awNfzGIqRXjYOu9xyTsVJQ4x4Je-odBD0X0wooyPBMRJE15yZeEiyiVTkTMhkfuGfbBxAVN6ngDS2BCD6KD8rBwVrEkM2t-nVBMIAjKewvqQPn5Lnz9r40jY8d0iKHyzdCrTwPQb1l6HvZkL1wX0ggdrovx4hE2J5-udRvfAB-ZpqDAocCljQ8aa8xKbmV01plW7P-WepoTDgKh3QSeT_efGU9jKtMdJh4TFO5HOjxdoBY5xFwYGzCzCOT1brIbs2Sgtx4sYCumxgACKTHZzsjWxzY-FoXEfaH3gPvE67DUfSmLA#resource-listing), I was able to conduct a cluster analysis of instructional expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, median earnings after graduation, and social mobility rates. 

**Cluster 1** has the highest standard deviations of instructional expenditures compared to other clusters. Standard deviations of median earnings are high above the average as well, while net cost of attendance are below average. The social mobility rate is slightly above the average.

**Cluster 2** has the highest standard deviations of net cost of attendance, while instructional expenditures and median earnings are slightly above the average. The social mobility rate is below the average.

**Cluster 3** has the highest standard deviations of median earnings. Instructional expenditures are slightly above the average and net cost of attendance is below the average. The social mobility rate is slightly below the average.

**Cluster 4** has standard deviations of all instructional expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings above the average. The social mobility rate is very high above the average.

From this analysis, Columbia University had the highest social mobility rate. The school also had instructional expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings higher than the average. We could say that there is a positive correlation between these factors and social mobility rate. 

## Cluster Chart

**Cluster 1**:Instructional Expenditures
**Cluster 2**:Net Cost of Attendance
**Cluster 3**:Median Earnings
**Cluster 4**:Mobility Rate

The chart above displays that Columbia Unviersity has the highest mobility rate while intructional expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings are not significantly high compared to other schools. While Berkshire Community College has the highest median earnings, the social mobility rate is below the average. Thus, it would be insignificant to conclude that intructional expenditures, net cost of attendacne, and median earnings affect the social mobility rate from this visual.  

## Conclusion
Social mobility rates are becoming an important factor to consider when students are choosing their colleges. As there could be many factors contributing to the mobility rates, I have decided to conduct a cluster analysis to find the relationship between instruction expenditures per student, net cost of attendance, median earnings after graduation, and social mobility rates. 
From the cluster analysis, Columbia University shows that it has the highest social mobility rates, while instruction expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings also above the average. While we might be able to say that there is a positive correlation, the graph actually shows that Columbia's instruction expenditures, net cost of attendance, and median earnings are not significantly higher compared to other schools which had low mobility rates.
